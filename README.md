# Time-Out

It was December 11, 2021 when Benjamin Boswell was first welcomed onto the BSS staff team to launch the Time Out project. Benjamin Boswell was the primary designer and ideator behind Time Out and we appreciate the countless hours of hard work he has poured into the project. Unfortunately, due to the conflicting interests of Ben and the BSS executives, Ben has decided to leave BSS and take the Time Out art, documentation, and designs with him.

Due to the design team losing some very integral work to the project, and to respect the hard work of Ben, the Time Out project has been canceled, and will never be resurfaced by BSS in the future. To commemorate how far BSS has come with the development of Time Out, Ben and the team have agreed to go against our normal procedures and make what we have created so far open source software as a public archive on GitHub. You are free to fork or clone the repository to play around, but will not be able to create pull requests due to the repository's archival.

What this means for BSS is that we will need at least a month to recover and start the development process again. We already have some ideas fairly set and ready to go, but if you have any ideas please let us know in the game feedback channel. Who knows? Your ideas may just find your way into one of our games!

We appreciate your understanding and hope to release our first game relatively soon. Feel free to check the dev log channel for any development updates, and if you have any questions regarding this, please let us know!
